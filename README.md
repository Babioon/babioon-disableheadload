babioon-disableheadload
=======================

Disable some files that normally would be loaded.

This System plugin lets you disable some of the fiels that would be loaded. 
If you like to disable mootools.js and caption.js my suggestion is to use this https://github.com/phproberto/plg_sys_mootable

If you still need caption for pictures then take a look at https://github.com/rdeutz/babioon-caption

To build the package you need phing installed on your machine a prepared package can be found here: http://d.pr/f/ZfjP

Have fun disabling unneeded files, don't blame me when your site not works.
