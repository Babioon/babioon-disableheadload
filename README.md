=======================

Disable some files that normally would be loaded.

This System plugin lets you disable some of the fiels that would be loaded. 
Usefull when you don't need mootools-core.js and caption.js.

If you still need caption for pictures then take a look at https://github.com/rdeutz/babioon-caption

To build the package you need phing installed on your machine a prepared package can be found here: http://d.pr/f/ZfjP

Have fun disabling unneeded files, don't blame me when your site not works.
